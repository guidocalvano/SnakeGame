==== THERE ARE MANY BRANCHES, CHECK TO PICK THE ONE YOU NEED ====


The most important branch is serialArduino and contains the ArduinoScreen and snake game for the lld (led light district).

see testScreen.js for use.

make sure the constructor of ArduinoScreen is invoked with the correct serial port: probably '/dev/ttyACM0' on linux or '/dev/tty.usbmodem1a21' on mac

the mac will keep changing the serial port name. sometimes mac can troll you.

to run:

the test screen
node ./r.js testScreen.js

the snake game
node ./r.js main.js
