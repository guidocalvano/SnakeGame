==== Overview ====

This code is meant to allow playing a Snake game on the LED Light District, a monitor based on LEDs and a glass cube wall we happened to find in our temporary hackerspace.

It is written in javascript.

Because testing requires seeing what is happening and the display isn't yet working I developed around a bunch of place holder screens.

One screen uses Raphael.js and works in the browser.

The second works on a node server, and is built on ogrejs (see https://github.com/guidocalvano/OgreJS )

OgreJS is a bit difficult to install and only works on mac, so contact me before working on it.


Two software tasks remain:

  * ScreenDriver: the code to interface with the actual screen 
  * PlayerManagement: everyone should get a turn to play

Right now I am going to work on PlayerManagement
