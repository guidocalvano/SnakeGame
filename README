==== Overview ====

This code is meant to allow playing a Snake game on the LED Light District, a monitor based on LEDs and a glass cube wall we happened to find in our temporary hackerspace.

It is written in javascript.

Because testing requires seeing what is happening and the display isn't yet working I developed around a bunch of place holder screens, that I developed in branches.

A server screen; The second works on a node server, and is built on ogrejs (see https://github.com/guidocalvano/OgreJS )

This version contains most working code. It can be found in the branch *ogrejs*

OgreJS is a bit difficult to install and only works on mac, so contact me before working on it.


A browser screen; one screen uses Raphael.js and works in the browser. 

It was just to get the game working. The screen might be useful but the rest should be ignored.
It can be found in the branch *basicClientGameWithRaphael*

Two software tasks remain:

  * ScreenDriver: the code to interface with the actual screen
  * PlayerManagement: everyone should get a turn to play

Right now I am going to work on PlayerManagement
